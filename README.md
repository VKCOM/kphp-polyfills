# kphp-polyfills

**Polyfills** are PHP implementations of functions supported by KPHP natively.  
Without polyfills, your code can be compiled, but can't be run by plain PHP.


## How to install and use this package

* Run `composer require vkcom/kphp-polyfills`

* If it's your first installed package, call composer autoload:
```php
require_once '.../vendor/autoload.php';
``` 

* You are done! All KPHP functions would work on plain PHP.
